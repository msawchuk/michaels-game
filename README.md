The main purpose of this repo is as a demonstration of my ability to put up a website that hosts a game. The game itself is not fully implemented as the goal here was to practice putting up a website over developing a game.

If you want to run this game locally, you will need to set up your own MongoDB instance and change config.json to match your own configuration. You can then run the server by inputting the commands npx webpack and npm run start. It will run on localhost, but there is commented code in index.js to run it on an actual domain, should you have one.
